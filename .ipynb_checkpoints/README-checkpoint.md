# Background
Fraud is prevalent these days, whether you are a small taco shop or a large international business. While there are emerging technologies that employ machine learning and artificial intelligence to detect fraud, many instances of fraud detection still require strong data analytics to find abnormal charges.

In this homework assignment, we'll analyze historical credit card transactions and consumption patterns in order to identify possible fraudulent transactions.

We'll accomplish three main tasks:   

1. Data Modeling: Define a database model to store the credit card transactions data and create a new PostgreSQL database using your model.
2. Data Engineering: Create a database schema on PostgreSQL and populate your database from the CSV files provided.
3. Data Analysis: Analyze the data to identify possible fraudulent transactions trends data, and develop a report of your observations.

# Data Modeling
We create an entity relationship diagram (ERD) by inspecting the provided CSV files. Part of the challenge here was to figure out how many tables we should create, as well as what kind of relationships we need to define among the tables. 

# Data Engineering
Using your database model as a blueprint, we then create a database schema for each of our tables and relationships; defining data types, primary keys, foreign keys, etc. After creating the database schema, we imported the data from the corresponding CSV files.

# Data Analysis: 
Analyze the data to identify possible fraudulent transactions trends data, and develop a report of your observations.
